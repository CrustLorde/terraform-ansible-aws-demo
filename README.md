# Terraform + Ansible + AWS Demo

A DevOps automation project demonstrating how to **provision cloud infrastructure** with **Terraform**, configure and deploy a **Flask web app** with **Ansible**, and run the application inside **Docker containers** on an AWS EC2 instance.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project automates the entire lifecycle of a simple web application deployment:

1. **Terraform** provisions AWS infrastructure (EC2 instance, networking, and security groups).
2. **Ansible** connects to the EC2 instance via SSH and:
   - Installs Docker & Docker Compose
   - Uploads a sample Flask app
   - Builds and runs the app container
3. The Flask app is exposed via a public IP address provided by Terraform.
